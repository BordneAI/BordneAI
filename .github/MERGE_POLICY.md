# 🔁 Merge Policy – BordneAI

## Merge Strategy
We use **Squash Merging only** for all pull requests to maintain:
- Clean commit history
- Symbolic traceability of logic changes
- Audit-friendly changelog entries

## Default Commit Message Format
> **Pull request title and description**

Each pull request should include:
- A semantic version in the title (e.g. `[v0.3.0]`)
- A clear bullet-style summary of logic or symbolic changes
- References to issues, design specs, or compliance notes

## Commit History Principles
- No anonymous merges
- No “default message” commits
- All entries are trace-compliant and audit-capable

---

🔐 This policy ensures reproducibility, architectural clarity, and compliance integrity across the BordneAI stack.
