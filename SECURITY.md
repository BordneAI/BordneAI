# Security Policy – BordneAI Profile Repo

This repository is my public GitHub profile and a hub for BordneAI projects.
Most executable code and workflows live in other repositories (for example,
3i/ATLAS Gateway Guide and related bundles). However, this repo still follows
the same disclosure and safety practices.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any BordneAI repository
(including this profile), please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue with sensitive details.
2. Contact me via the email listed on my GitHub profile or on bordne.com.
3. Include:
   - Repository name and file(s)
   - A minimal description and reproduction steps (if applicable)
   - Any potential impact you foresee

I will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond within 72 hours.

## Scope

- This repo: profile README and metadata.
- Linked BordneAI projects: see the “Pinned repositories” section.

## Expectations

- I do not pay bounties at this time.
- Responsible disclosure only; no exploitation beyond minimal proof.
- Please avoid scanning that could degrade service for GitHub or others.
