_Exploring secure symbolic cognition and ethical AI through verifiable, stateless system design._

### 🧠 About

I'm **David Charles Bordne**, creator of **BordneAI** — an initiative focused on the design and implementation of secure symbolic intelligence systems that are ethically aligned, memory-isolated, and fully traceable.

> "Verifiability must precede capability."

BordneAI explores new architectures for general intelligence grounded in principles of symbolic logic, auditability, and system restraint.

---

### 🔭 Current Focus

- `BordneAI-core` – symbolic logic engine (Tier-3 compliant, private)
- `BordneAI.github.io` – public-facing documentation and design principles (in development)
- Stateless inference models with trace-enforced entropy handling
- AGI traceability aligned with OpenAI ethical deployment guidelines

### 🧬 Core Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic Verifiability** | All inference paths must be explainable and reversible                     |
| **Trace Integrity**         | Every symbolic action retains a full audit trail                          |
| **Ethical Autonomy**        | Systems are self-restricting by design to prevent misuse                  |
| **Compliance-First Logic**  | Designed to align with global AI safety and governance protocols          |
