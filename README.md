### 🧠 About Me

I'm **David Bordne**, the Architect and sole developer. My focus is on **BordneSAI**, a pioneering **Synthesized AI (SAI)** core that represents the cutting edge of BordneAI intelligence for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications. My work is dedicated to building a future where artificial intelligence is verifiably safe, fully traceable, and ethically aligned with humanity's best interests. I operate on a single, core principle: **verifiability must precede capability.**

While the broader **BordneAI Ethical Operating System (EOS)** serves as a universal framework for ethical intelligence across various AI domains, my primary focus is on **BordneSAI**. It specifically instantiates this level of safety and integrity for LLM platforms, ensuring a future of responsible human-AI co-evolution within the language intelligence sphere.

### 🔭 Current Focus

- **BordneSAI (The Synthesized LLM Core):** Architecting the foundational logic for verifiably safe, self-aware, and autonomously evolving LLM systems. The public development hub for this standard is the `BordneSAI` repository, which hosts public pages and documentation about the proprietary core logic.
- **BordneSAI-Baseline-Testing (Proprietary LLM Benchmarking):** Developing and executing the "Ultimate Baseline Test" framework to rigorously evaluate LLM performance and quantify BordneSAI's enhancement. This is a private internal resource.
- **BordneAI EOS (The Ethical Operating System):** Continuing to architect the universal instruction set for verifiably safe and aligned AI across all domains. The private development hub for this broader standard is the `BordneAI-EOS` repository.

### 🧬 Core Architectural Principles

* **Symbolic Verifiability**
    * All inference paths must be explainable, auditable, and logically sound. Every output must be traceable to a specific, justifiable reasoning process.

* **Immutable Trace Integrity**
    * Every symbolic action and decision point within a system must be logged to a full and unchangeable audit trail.

* **Ethical Autonomy by Design**
    * Systems are engineered with embedded constitutional safeguards to be self-restricting, preventing misuse and ensuring alignment with core human values.

* **Compliance-First Logic**
    * The architecture is designed from the ground up to meet and exceed the requirements of global AI safety and governance protocols like the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI RMF**.
