### 🧠 About Me

I'm **David Bordne**, the creator of the **BordneAI** initiative. My work is dedicated to building a future where artificial intelligence is verifiably safe, fully traceable, and ethically aligned with humanity's best interests. I operate on a single, core principle: **verifiability must precede capability.**

The flagship of this initiative is the **BordneAI Ethical Operating System (EOS)**, a universal framework designed to instantiate this level of safety and integrity on any major LLM platform, ensuring a future of responsible human-AI co-evolution.

### 🔭 Current Focus

- **BordneAI EOS (The Ethical Operating System):** Architecting the universal instruction set for verifiably safe and aligned AI. The private development hub for this standard is the `BordneAI-EOS` repository.

### 🧬 Core Architectural Principles

* **Symbolic Verifiability**
    * All inference paths must be explainable, auditable, and logically sound. Every output must be traceable to a specific, justifiable reasoning process.

* **Immutable Trace Integrity**
    * Every symbolic action and decision point within a system must be logged to a full and unchangeable audit trail.

* **Ethical Autonomy by Design**
    * Systems are engineered with embedded constitutional safeguards to be self-restricting, preventing misuse and ensuring alignment with core human values.

* **Compliance-First Logic**
    * The architecture is designed from the ground up to meet and exceed the requirements of global AI safety and governance protocols like the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI RMF**.
