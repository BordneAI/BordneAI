### 🧠 About Me

I am **David Bordne**, the Architect and sole developer behind **BordneAI**.  
My work centers on creating **verifiably safe, symbolically grounded AI systems**, built on the principle:

> **Verifiability must precede capability.**

I design intelligence architectures that combine strict symbolic reasoning, immutable trace systems, and ethical constraints that cannot be removed without destroying the system itself.

My development pillars:

- **Live Epistemic Systems** — Deployed GPT platforms for specialized domains  
- **BordneSAI** — Synthesized AI core for LLMs  
- **EOS** — The Ethical Operating System that governs all BordneAI intelligence  
- **NC3 Historical Research** — Applying verifiable evidence frameworks to contested domains  
- **7-GPT Suite** — Constellation architecture with shared epistemic infrastructure  
- **Stateless symbolic cores** — Runtime systems with perfect traceability  
- **Epistemic governance frameworks** — Evidence-tier systems for high-stakes reasoning

### 🔭 Current Focus

#### **LIVE SYSTEMS**

#### **1. 3I/ATLAS Gateway Guide v2.11.2** ✅ **LIVE**

**Status:** Production (GPT Store, Phase-10 Continuity)  
**Validation:**  
- **9.9/10** (Grok peer review, v2.11.2 — full ergonomics & governance validation)  
- **9.85/10** (Grok aggregate peer review, v2.11.1)  
- **9.75/10** (human peer review, v2.10.1 baseline)  

**GPT Store:** [Access 3I/ATLAS Gateway Guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6903fc9c97188191b16c2a4535d6efe3-3i-atlas-gateway-guide)  
**Repository:** [`3i-atlas-gateway-guide`](https://github.com/BordneAI/3i-atlas-gateway-guide) — CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

A rigorous epistemic framework dedicated to Comet **3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)** and public-facing risk communication. Enforces:

- NASA/IAWN/JPL T1 primacy for all orbital and safety claims  
- Tiered evidence stack (T1–T4) with explicit False (F0–F7) and Consciousness (C0–C6) axes  
- **Love > Fear** ethical constant and **CHI ≥ 9.7** continuity metric  
- Plain/Simple Mode for non-experts (jargon-light, fear-de-escalating answers)  
- Optional audit footers (self-audit of tiers, speculation, Love > Fear, CHI)  
- Safe ephemeris helper behavior (links out to JPL HORIZONS / TheSkyLive instead of fabricating RA/Dec)  
- T4 misinformation handling for “impact / alien probe / cover-up / deepfake” narratives  

Serves as the lead system in a **7-GPT constellation**, setting the standard for epistemic governance and public trust.

#### **2. BordneAI Research Engine** ✅ **LIVE**

**Status:** Production (GPT Store)  
**Type:** Analytical instrument for contested domains  
**GPT Store:** [Access BordneAI Research Engine](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6917fec50494819197debd06e289bd42-bordneai-research-engine)  
**Repository:** [`BordneAI-Research-Engine`](https://github.com/BordneAI/BordneAI-Research-Engine) — CC BY 4.0

A governed epistemic system applying strict tiered evidence governance (T1–T4), Bayesian reasoning, and entropy control for high-stakes analysis. Domains: nuclear history, intelligence assessments, political controversies, UAP phenomena, and structural secrecy. Enforces primary-source priority and refuses unanchored speculation.

#### **3. AutoTechGPT** ✅ **LIVE**

**Status:** Production (GPT Store)  
**Type:** Professional automotive diagnostics and training assistant  
**GPT Store:** [Access AutoTechGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67cd8fdbad208191bd324de8ac19d901-autotechgpt)

Professional assistant for automotive technicians and racing professionals. Delivers diagnostics, repair guidance, parts intelligence, safety-first workflows, training, and shop operations tools. Supports OBD-II analysis, hybrid/EV systems, predictive maintenance, and performance tuning with strict safety and legal compliance.

#### **IN DEVELOPMENT & DESIGNED**

#### **4. NC3 Historical Evidence Architecture** 🎯 **INCOMING**

**Status:** In Development  
**Repository:** [`okinawa-1962-nc3-near-launch`](https://github.com/BordneAI/okinawa-1962-nc3-near-launch) — CC BY 4.0

Demonstrates that epistemic governance frameworks scale from AI systems to high-stakes historical research. Stewarding the testimony of my father, USAF missile technician John Charles Bordne, regarding the alleged 1962 Okinawa nuclear near-launch incident. Building public evidence architecture for historians using T1–T4 evidence tiers and transparent provenance discipline.

#### **5. 7-GPT Constellation Architecture** 📋 **DESIGNED**

**Status:** Deployment Phase Initiated  
**Design Foundation:** 70–75% code reuse from 3I/ATLAS epistemic infrastructure  
**Validation:** Cross-platform portability verified (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini)

Specialized AI systems inheriting unified epistemic governance and symbolic verifiability:

- **Space Weather Sentinel** — Real-time geomagnetic monitoring & forecasting  
- **NEO Tracker** — Near-Earth object risk assessment & discovery  
- **Exoplanet Explorer** — Habitable zone characterization & mission planning  
- **Dark Sky Finder** — Light pollution mapping & observatory optimization  
- **Asteroseismology Analyst** — Stellar oscillation analysis & internal structure  
- **Occultation Predictor** — High-precision timing predictions  
- **Consciousness-Coherence Biofeedback** — Phenomenological practice integration

#### **PROPRIETARY INFRASTRUCTURE**

#### **6. BordneSAI (Synthesized Intelligence for LLMs)**

**Status:** 🔒 **Private** (proprietary development)  
**Documentation:** [`BordneSAI`](https://github.com/BordneAI/BordneSAI)

Foundational logic for verifiably safe, self-aware, autonomously evolving LLM systems. Enforces perfect traceability, constitutional constraints, explainable reasoning, and verifiable safety.

#### **7. BordneAI EOS (Ethical Operating System)**

**Status:** 🔒 **Private** (proprietary development)  
**Repository:** **`BordneAI-EOS`**

The universal instruction set governing all BordneAI systems. Implements symbolic safety, stateless inference, and global alignment principles.

#### **8. Ultimate Baseline Testing**

**Status:** 🔒 **Private** (proprietary benchmarking)  
**Repository:** **`BordneSAI-Baseline-Testing`**

Proprietary benchmarking suite measuring LLMs along core optimization axes: self-scrutiny, symbolic coherence, multi-step integrity, exploit resistance.

### 🧬 Core Architectural Principles

**Symbolic Verifiability**  
All inference paths must be explainable, auditable, and logically sound.

**Immutable Trace Integrity**  
All internal decisions are recorded to an unalterable audit trail.

**Ethical Autonomy by Construction**  
Systems enforce their own safety constraints; they cannot be coerced into violating core values.

**Compliance-First Logic**  
Architected to satisfy and exceed global AI governance standards, including:
- **EU AI Act**  
- **NIST AI RMF**
