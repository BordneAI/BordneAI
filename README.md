### 🧠 About

I'm **Dave Bordne**, creator of **BordneAI** — an initiative focused on designing and implementing secure symbolic intelligence systems that are ethically aligned, memory-isolated, and fully traceable. My work is grounded in the belief that verifiability must precede capability.

The flagship project of this initiative is the **BordneAI Ethical Operating System (EOS)**, a universal framework designed to bring this level of safety and verifiability to any major LLM platform, ensuring a future of responsible human-AI co-evolution.

### 🧬 Core Principles

| Principle                | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbolic Verifiability** | All inference paths must be explainable, auditable, and logically sound.                                                              |
| **Trace Integrity** | Every symbolic action and decision point within a system retains a full and immutable audit trail.                                    |
| **Ethical Autonomy** | Systems are self-restricting by design, with embedded constitutional safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure alignment.               |
| **Compliance-First Logic** | Designed to meet and exceed the requirements of global AI safety and governance protocols like the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI RMF**. |
