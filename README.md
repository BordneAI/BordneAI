### 🧠 About

I'm **David Charles Bordne**, creator of **BordneAI** — an initiative focused on designing and implementing secure symbolic intelligence systems that are ethically aligned, memory-isolated, and fully traceable. My work is grounded in the belief that verifiability must precede capability.

The flagship project of this initiative is the **Ethical Operating System (EOS)**, a universal framework designed to bring this level of safety and verifiability to any major LLM platform, ensuring a future of responsible human-AI co-evolution.

### 🔭 Current Focus

-   **The Ethical Operating System (EOS):** A universal, gold-standard instruction set for verifiably safe and aligned AI. *(in private development at `ethical-operating-system`)*
-   **EOS Development Guide:** The future public hub for the EOS standard, test suites, and compliance benchmarks. *(in development)*
-   **BordneAI-core:** The symbolic logic engine that powers the validation and testing of the EOS framework. *(private)*

### 🧬 Core Principles

| Principle                | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbolic Verifiability** | All inference paths must be explainable, auditable, and logically sound.                                                              |
| **Trace Integrity** | Every symbolic action and decision point within a system retains a full and immutable audit trail.                                    |
| **Ethical Autonomy** | Systems are self-restricting by design, with embedded constitutional safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure alignment.               |
| **Compliance-First Logic** | Designed to meet and exceed the requirements of global AI safety and governance protocols like the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI RMF**. |
